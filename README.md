```
Hearken, O developers, and let these ten eternal edicts ring out across the forges of code:

Upon each fragment of your realm there shall dwell but one purpose.
Let no module chase two masters. In the singularity of its duty, it shall stand resolute and true.

In the domain of the context there shall be but one sovereign.
Call not upon shadows of multiple worlds. One reality rules, and within its bounds you build your logic.

Speak not of what you do not see, nor whisper of that which is hidden.
Honour the least-knowing path: each component shall know only its near realm, shielded from distant mysteries.

Raise the veil of complexity through abstraction, that your castle may soar.
Let the scaffolding of thought lift your design high, while the under-work remains masked in subtle strength.

Separate the heralds of command from the scribes of query.
One calls to action, the other seeks its tale — let them never wear each other’s cloak.

Let your creation stand unshaken amidst storms of input and fury of fault.
Make it robust, make it unbowed — for when the tempest comes, it shall endure.

Greet the horizon of future possibility with open arms.
Your work shall welcome new powers and honours, even as the stars uplift their glow.

Yet bind the soul of your craft fast against the winds of change.
Let your core remain sealed — for to change the bedrock is to shatter the monument.

In simplicity lies the might of the mountain.
Excess is the twin of ruin; let less be more, and grandeur shall flourish in restraint.

Keep the single beacon of truth alight within your empire.
Let one source shine, unwavering and unique — for when truth divides, all structure falls.

Go forth, champion of code, and weave these commandments into your temples of logic — that your architecture may become legend.
```
